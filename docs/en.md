## December 1, 2019
* The first Wuhan citizen had an unexplained pneumonia symptom (diagnosed afterwards, but unknown pneumonia was unknown at the time, and no doctor found and reported yet). According to Wu Wenjuan, director of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Jinyintan Hospital, the patient was a man over 70 years old with a little cerebral infarction and dementia. After the onset, he was first sent to another hospital in Wuhan, but as his condition deteriorated, he was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital on December 29. The old man lived far away from the four or five stops (bus station) of the seafood market. Because he had been ill at home before, he basically did not go out and did not go to the South China Seafood Market. The time of onset on December 1 was the conclusion drawn from the recall of comprehensive family members through an epidemiological survey. See [Chaolin Huang, et al. Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. The Lancet, Jan. 24, 2020 (Clinical features of 2019 new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China)](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/26#issue-557972097 ) and [BBC 中文:Pneumonia Epidemic: Ambiguous "Zero Patient" and Virus Controversy](https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-51540821). <br>
[Press, pay attention to the difference between the occurrence of illness, admission, diagnosis of "unexplained (viral) pneumonia", diagnosis of "new coronary pneumonia", determination of limited person-to-person transmission, and determination of continuous person-to-person transmission.

## December 4, 2019
* [Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control](http://www.hbcdc.cn/index.php/index-view.html?aid=8128) held the province ’s online direct reporting code in December 4-7 Maintenance and geographic analysis application training courses, the heads of the departments responsible for the management of infectious disease epidemic reports in 17 cities and prefectures of the province and the business personnel responsible for the maintenance of standard coding participated in this training. The meeting was chaired by Director Huang Shuqiong of the Disease Surveillance Department of the Information Institute, and Vice President Huang Xibao of the Provincial Center for Disease Control, Director Li Mingyan of the Information Institute, and Deputy Director Liu Kehao attended the opening ceremony. Dean Huang put forward three points of view: first, to affirm the results, to conscientiously summarize, to ensure that the comprehensive quality of infectious disease information is the best in the country; second, to attach great importance to and clearly define the requirements to ensure that the annual code maintenance work is completed on time and in quality; The third is to seize the opportunity and make active breakthroughs to ensure that disease surveillance big data plays a role in disease prevention and control. <br>

## December 8, 2019
* On January 11th, the earliest onset patients in the  [Wuhan City Health and Health Commission Bulletin](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020011109036) began to develop symptoms. According to news from the medical treatment team of the Wuhan New Coronary Pneumonia Prevention and Control Command, the patient with the surname Chen was later cured and discharged from the hospital. The patient lives in a community in Wuchang and denied having been to the South China Seafood Market. See [Wuhan release:Wuhan: The earliest registered patients with new coronary pneumonia developed the disease on December 8 last year](https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_6169432). <br>

## December 9, 2019
## December 10, 2019
* Three Wuhan citizens were admitted to the hospital with symptoms (diagnosed afterwards, and one case was later reported to be related to South China Seafood City, and there was no epidemiological connection between this patient and the first patient. This means at least The South China Seafood Market should not be regarded as the only source of virus). See [Chaolin Huang, et al. Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. The Lancet, Jan. 24, 2020 (Clinical features of 2019 new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China)](https: //github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/26#issue-557972097 ). <br>

## December 12, 2019
* Outpatient doctor Liu Yong (pseudonym) of Wuhan Youfu Hospital (200 meters away from South China Seafood Market) received a merchant Huang (69 years old) from South China Seafood Market. The patient had dry cough, no fever and no runny nose. At the same time, the patient revealed that seven or eight merchant employees next door had symptoms of high fever. See February 11 [Eight o'clock Jianwen Lost Opportunity, Case of Small Hospital Early Neglected in New Crown Outbreak](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/91). <br>
* On the same day, a 69-year-old (70-year-old) Zheng distributer who was responsible for the procurement business of a hotel in Jingzhou in the South China Seafood Market began to have fever symptoms. Initially, the infusion failed to reduce the fever in the small clinic. On December 16, he went to Wuhan Youfu Hospital for treatment. After treatment, the condition still did not alleviate. At the doctor's recommendation, he was transferred to Wuhan Red Cross Hospital for inpatient treatment. After 7 days of hospitalization, the situation has not improved, and he was transferred to Tongji Hospital on December 24 for treatment. After being treated for fever, he was originally prepared to be discharged from the hospital, but was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital on December 29 (31st), and then healed before returning to Jingzhou in Wuhan. This patient should be the "earliest onset" who was first notified by the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission on January 5th [third announcement](http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/showDetail/2020010509020) .

* Liu Yong (pseudonym), an outpatient doctor at Wuhan Youfu Hospital, reminded colleagues that as long as they come to see the doctor in the South China Seafood Market, everyone will provide a general surgical mask for free. He also recommended that all doctors in the radiology and outpatient departments wear masks. See February 11 [Eight o'clock Jianwen Lost Opportunity, Case of Small Hospital Early Neglected in New Crown Outbreak](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/91). <br>
* On the same day (one said on December 15), a 65-year-old male delivery person from the South China Seafood Market began to develop fever symptoms and went to the outpatient clinic of Wuhan Central Hospital (Nanjing Road Campus) on December 16. After oral medication, the patient's condition still failed to improve, and he was admitted to the emergency ward of the hospital on December 18. Because the fever did not retreat and the etiology was unknown, Wuhan Central Hospital performed alveolar fiber bronchoscopy lavage sampling on the patient on December 24 and sent the sample to Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. for NGS testing to determine the pathogen [see 12 Entry on January 26]. Before the test results were obtained, the patient was transferred to Tongji Hospital for treatment on December 25, then transferred to Jinyintan Hospital on December 30, and died on January 30, 2020. This patient is the earliest known case of a novel coronavirus. See [Li-Li Ren, et al. Identification of a novel coronavirus causing severe pneumonia in human: a descriptive study.

* Around December 16-17, a 44-year-old Northeast male working in a frozen fresh food stall in the South China Seafood Market began to develop fever. After several days of persistent high fever at home, he went to Wuhan No. 6 Hospital for hospitalization and was transferred to Tongji Hospital on December 24 for treatment. Later, the hospital took a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid sample from the patient on December 26 and sent the sample to Huada Gene for detection of the pathogenic microorganism NGS. The patient was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital for treatment on December 31. Another said that the patient was transferred to Peking Union Medical College Hospital and sampled and sent to Huada Gene Test. Huada Gene detected that the virus and SARS gene sequence similarity in the sample was as high as 80%, but the SARS test kit test was negative. On December 30, BGI gene orally informed the Union Hospital of the test results, and recommended that the hospital report to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission [see entry on January 1].

According to February 2 [Changjiang Daily How did she find this kind of different pneumonia when she first reported the epidemic](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/E_FMh8T31ZnTFhi-5wZCbw) On that day, two old couples were treated in Hubei At the Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, the receiving doctor was Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory and Intensive Medicine. "At that time, the two men came to the hospital by themselves. The chest CT films they took showed completely different changes from other viral pneumonia." . Zhang Jixian "Let the old couple call their son for examination. The son has no symptoms, but the CT is taken, and there is that kind of manifestation on the lungs." Afterwards, Zhang Jixian was interviewed by the "Changjiang Daily" and said "it was exercised during the SARS period thinking". On the same day, "I also came to a merchant in the South China Seafood Market, with the same fever, cough, and the same lung performance." (Here is the same as described in the previous paper). <br>
* On the same day, an employee of Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. detected an unknown virus in a sample sent by the Wuhan Central Hospital, with 87% similarity to bat coronavirus and 81% similarity to SARS [see December 13 Day entry]. See [WeChat public account Hilldog :Record the experience of the first discovery of a new coronavirus](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/36#issue-558471531). <br>

## December 27, 2019
* Two Wuhan citizens suffered from illness (diagnosed afterwards, it was later known that it was related to South China Seafood City). See [Chaolin Huang, et al. Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. The Lancet, Jan. 24, 2020 (Clinical features of 2019 new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China)](https: / /github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/26#issue-557972097). <br>
* On the same day, Director Zhang Jixian of the Department of Respiratory and Intensive Medicine of the Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine in Hubei Province reported the situation of these four people (the same symptoms of chest chest radiography) to the business dean Xia Wenguang, the hospital's hospital office and the medical department, and the hospital immediately reported To Jianghan District CDC. Wang Wenyong, Section Chief of Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Center, Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan received the report, arrived at the hospital for sampling at 16 o'clock, and left at 18 o'clock. (The Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine is also called Xinhua Hospital of Hubei Province, only 1 km away from Jianghan Disease Control). That night, Wang Wenyong and his colleagues were busy testing the samples, and both A and B were negative. They informed the on-duty doctors of the Provincial Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine that they would go to the Municipal Disease Control Center for the detection of other pathogens the next morning. See April 2 [China News Weekly · Back to the Director of Wuhan Primary Disease Control: No one expected this disease to be so ruthless](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/172#issue-593162687) . <br>
* At around 18:00, Zhang Dingyu, the dean of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, and Huang Chaolin, the dean of the dean, were in the office. Dean Huang received a call from a professor in Tongji Hospital, saying that he would refer a patient to Jinyintan. The other side said that it was a patient infected with coronavirus, but did not say pneumonia. So the two immediately called the experts of Beijing Ditan Hospital and asked if we should accept this patient? The expert of Ditan Hospital immediately replied, "You should take it. Jinyintan is an infectious disease hospital. You should pay attention to this patient." So she immediately called Tongji Hospital and asked them to turn the patient over. This patient was originally referred to Tongji from the Second Hospital of Wuhan City (Wuhan Central Hospital). He was not willing to be transferred to an institution like ours. While Tongji is doing work for patients, Jinyintan is also preparing to understand what is going on with the coronavirus. At the same time, Zhang Dingyu called a third-party testing company. According to Zhang recalls, this company is also very cautious. The report they gave for the first time did not indicate "coronavirus", only "RNA virus was not detected", but they told the doctor in Tongji on the phone. Jinyintan asked the third-party company to provide sequencing and found the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences on the same day. It was about 10 o'clock at night. The comparison is most similar to "SARS-like coronaviruses derived from bats", and the agreement is very high. At the time, the Virus Office also told Jinyintan on the phone, and there was no report. See March 17 [Voice of China : [Oral Record] Zhang Dingyu: I am in the Eye of the Storm ｜ Wuhan Wuhan](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/168#issue-583557307) Zhang Dingyu recalled . <br>
* On the same day, an employee of Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. shared coronavirus-related data with the Institute of Pathology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Recognizing that this was a sudden virus, the company fully disinfected the laboratory and called the hospital to discover the corona virus and took isolation measures for the patient, but did not give a written report. In the next few days, the company's leaders went to Wuhan Tongji Hospital and CDC to report the situation. See [WeChat public account Hilldog :Record the first experience of discovering a new coronavirus](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/36#issue-558471531), February 19 [Finance Magazine:Who was the first patient with a new coronavirus pneumonia genetically detected? ](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TIIhyEwbljCt9fewIGvLyg) and February 26 [Caixin Network : New Coronavirus Gene Sequencing Traceability: When the alarm sounded](https://github.com / Pratitya / wuhan2020-timeline / issues / 132). <br>
* On the same day, patient Li Jing (pseudonym) entered the Houhu Hospital of Wuhan Central Hospital due to gallbladder disease. Since then, four merchants from the South China Seafood Market have been seen in the emergency ward for pneumonia. See January 1 [Beijing News: Wuhan South China Seafood Market has been closed, and unexplained pneumonia has a mature monitoring system](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/inside/2020/01/01/668935.html ). <br>

* The emergency department of Houhu District of Wuhan Central Hospital received 4 cases of fever related to the South China Seafood Market. By January 1, 2020, the hospital had admitted 7 cases of "unexplained pneumonia". See February 17 [China News Weekly : Personal experience tells: the beginning and end of infection of medical staff in Wuhan Central Hospital](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/106#issue-566625534). <br>
* The Department of Infectious Disease Control and Prevention of the Jianghan District Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Wuhan City sent the samples from the Hubei Chinese and Western Integrated Hospital to the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, where the laboratories conducted more than 20 pathogen tests and were still negative.

Zhang Dingyu thinks that since the genes of the virus are said to be there, why haven't we detected them? Not detected, indicating a problem. So Zhang Dingyu told Vice President Huang Chaolin: "No, we have to do alveolar lavage for all patients, first bronchoscopy, and then alveolar lavage." See March 17 [Voice of China:[dictation Transcript: Zhang Dingyu: I am in the eye of the storm ｜ Wuhan Wuhan](https://github.com/Pratitya/wuhan2020-timeline/issues/168#issue-583557307). <br>

* Xie Linka, a doctor at the Cancer Center of Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital, received an enquiry call from the police because of the transmission of unknown pneumonia information. See February 1st [Caixin.com:Another Coronet Pneumoniae appeared as a "whistleblower" and was verbally educated by the police](http://www.caixin.com/2020-02-01/101510170.html). <br>
* A number of doctors from different top three hospitals in Wuhan recalled that before and after that day, the leaders of their hospital had "verbally communicated to them a" report standard "of" unexplained viral pneumonia "" based on a "white cover manual". It even "requires that this reporting standard can only be communicated through face-to-face, telephone, or WeChat voice." This standard is the "Unexplained Viral Pneumonia Treatment Manual" (white cover) "Unexplained Viral Pneumonia Entry Standards" in this standard. This standard specifies that the conditions for the inclusion of unexplained viral pneumonia cases must also meet Epidemiological history (the contact history of the South China seafood market and its related personnel) and four clinical manifestations (1. Fever ≥ 38 ° C, 2. Pneumonia imaging characteristics, 3. Normal or decreased white blood cell counts or lymphocyte count decrease in the early stage of onset, 4. There is no improvement or exacerbation of the disease after 3 days of standard antibacterial drug treatment, and it cannot be clearly diagnosed as other diseases. The doctors interviewed believed that the "entry criteria" of the white-skin manual was too "critical", which was not conducive to early detection and early diagnosis. In addition, the White Skin Manual also contains the "Unknown Cause of Viral Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (Trial)", which defines the case as meeting four clinical standards (similar to the "Entry Criteria") ) Or meet the first three criteria plus epidemiological criteria (the patient has a history of exposure to the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan or a similar patient exposure history), and at the same time cannot be clearly diagnosed as a pneumonia case of other diseases [see entry on January 1]. The first group of experts of the National Health and Welfare Commission stated that this "diagnosis and treatment plan" was jointly developed by them and the local expert group of Hubei around January 3, but they did not participate in the formulation of "inclusion criteria" and were informed of this afterwards. Documents. According to media reports, what the expert group knew at the time was a green cover "work manual". The difference between the two cover "work manuals" was whether they were included in the "entry criteria". It was also reported that after seeing the white cover "Working Manual", members of the national and provincial expert groups requested the Wuhan Health and Health Commission to take back the manual and reprint it, that is, remove the green cover "Working Manual" after the "Entry Standards". However, the diagnostic and reporting standards implemented by the hospitals have not changed until the National Health and Health Commission released the first edition of the New Coronary Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program.
